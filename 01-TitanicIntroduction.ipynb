    "\n",
    "#### We can see, that we have 12 data columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can divide these columns already in two groups, numerical data and string data. NOTE: Strings have to be converted to numerical values before they can be used in a machine laerning application. This originates in the fact, that machine learning algorthims are all based on mathematical operations like multiplications, additions and non-linear functions and these only work with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by having a closer look at the numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The numerical data:\n",
    "The most important column is the `Survived` column. It provides the targets for training the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important one is the unique `PassengerId`, which serves throughout the whole process as a unique identification for data belonging to one person. This could also be done by the `Name` property, but similar names are possible, while similar ids aren't.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The other columns are:\n",
    "- `Pcclass`, giving the Class in which the passanger traveled\n",
    "- `SibSp`, giving the number of siblings / spouses aboard\n",
    "- `Parch`, giving the number of parents / children aboard\n",
    "- `Age`, giving the age of the passenger\n",
    "- `Fare`, giving the price of the passenger paid for his/her ticket\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an overview of the data, we can utilise one of the multiple functions of Pandas:\n",
    "- `.columns` property shows the different columns in the DataFrame\n",
    "- `.head(n)` returns the first n rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "- `.describe()` returns a general summary statistics for all columns in the DataFrame\n",
    "- `df[col]` returns the data in a certain col of the DataFrame as a Series\n",
    "- `df[col].unique()` returns the unique values of the column of a DataFrame\n",
    "- `df[col].value_counts()` returns the number of occurences of each unique value in a DataFrame as a Series"

    "- `count` gives the number valid values (excluded missing `NaN` vales)\n",
    "- `mean` provides the mean of all the values in the column.\n",

    "- `min` provides the minimum value in the column.\n",
    "- `25%` provides the lower quartile value of the column.\n",
    "- `50%` provides the median value of the column.\n",
    "- `75%` provides the upper quartile value of the column.\n",
    "- `max` provides the maximum value of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We already gain some conclusions from these summary statistics:\n",
    "- It was more probable to die, than to survive on the titanic, since the mean of the `Survived` column is only 0.38.\n",
    "- The `count` value is the same for all columns except the `Age` colum, where some values are missing.\n",
    "- Most people travelled alone as the `25%` and `50%` values for both `SibSp` and `Parch` are 0, while the former has a `75%` value of 1 and a maximum value of 8 and the latter a `75%` value of 0 and a maximum value of 6.\n",
    "- The fares are rising strongly towards the more expensive tickets.\n",
    "- Most of the tickets were third class tickets.\n",

    "## Pandas Indexing\n",
    "Before we continue, let us get a bit more comfortable with the way we can select data in pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select data in pandas we will use `.loc` and `__getitem__`. There are even more options which can be found in the [indexing and selecting data section of the pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas the `__getitem__` function returns the related column, so if we do `df[\"Survived\"]` we will retrieve the column indicating if a person survived or didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.loc` on the other hand allows us to select rows or rows and columns at the same time. E.g. `df[df[\"Survived\"] == True]` would return all data related to survivours, while `df[df[\"Survived\"] == True, \"Age\"]` would return the age of the survivours. Let's actually try this:\n",
    "- Select the data related to everyone older than 30\n",
    "- Return the parchment class (`\"Pclass\"`) for everyone paying more the 50 Pounds (`\"Fare\"`) for the journey"
